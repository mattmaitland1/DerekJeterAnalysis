    "To collect our data, we scraped online databases of baseball statistics in order to pull all of Derek Jeter’s in game statistics on a game by game basis for every game of his career ranging from 1995 to 2014. This data contained all of his batting statistics including variables such as OPS, BA, CS, GDP, SH, SF, HBP, SO, IBB, RE24, cWPA, and other such acronyms relating to baseball measurements. However, not all of these variables are applicable or comparable in regards to the type of inferences we are trying to make. Thus, in our data cleaning process, we first evaluated which of the variables would be appropriate and comparable for our studies. We came up with a final list of variables including year, home runs, hits, game result, stolen bases, base on balls, and win probability added. These variables are unique in that they are recorded on a game by game basis and do not accumulate, unlike some of the other variables that were included in the stat sheet. Then, with these specific statistics chosen, we cleaned the data by simply excluding the statistics that we did not want, and then combining the statistics that we did want into a single dataframe which is easily processable and neat. Through this process, we cut our dataset from 38 columns over 19 dataframes to a more readable six columns all in one dataframe. "

    "The SettingWithCopyWarning will be suppressed because the stats_clean function produces far too many warnings to the point of distraction and disturbance from the code. The warning arises because the stats_clean function produces a copy of data. However, we set this copy equal to the original dataframe created from loading in the CSV, such that the copy made becomes permanent and the warning is unnecessary."
